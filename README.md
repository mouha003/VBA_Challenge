Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
  One of the advantages of refactoring code is that the base work is there and all we have to do it tweak some things and solve a smaller portion of the problem rather than the entire problem. This is good because you can just focus on a narrowed problem rather than the whole.
  
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

  One of the disadvantages of refactoring code is that you must take some time to understand the code that is already given in order to start refactoring the code. Otherwise, this can lead to mistakes and break other connected pieces of the code due to not sufficiently understanding the bigger picture.
